- **Reports and explanations:**
  * USER table:

    + Connected to the product_review table where there is information about product reviews posted by the user
    + Connected to the collaboration table, which contains queries sent by the form regarding collaboration. If they were sent by a logged-in user, they will be associated with that user
    + Connected to the user_adress table, which contains user addresses that go there when placing the first order and are updated with each subsequent order.
    + Connected to the password_reset table where there are records regarding password reset (in case of forgetting, etc.) and tokens necessary for the reset
    + Connected to the cart table to assign a specific cart to a specific user
  * PRODUCT table:
    + Connected to the favorite_product and product_review tables. Explanations about the content of these tables can be found in point USER.
    + Linked to the product_photos table to assign photos to a specific product
